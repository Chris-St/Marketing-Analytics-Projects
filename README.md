Analytics projects that revolve around Marketing Data. 
A quick summary of the 4 projects currently in this repo:
1. DOS1 is a simple EDA and Regression Analysis of a typical Sales dataset
2. DOS2 is a collection of data from manually observing grocery store behaviour and using surveys. In this case PCA and clustering techniques were used to define customer segments.
3. Apache Classification is a full clean, EDA and finally logistic regression on the well-known portugese banking marketing dataset from the UCI repository.
4. Apache Clustering was an attempt to use clustering to group possible customers segments on the portugese banking marketing dataset.
